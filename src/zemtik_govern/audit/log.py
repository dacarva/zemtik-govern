"""Audit adapter — a thin layer over agentmesh's Merkle-chained ``AuditLog``.

The tamper-evidence (Merkle chain + HMAC + ``verify_integrity`` + ``get_proof``)
is an agentmesh primitive; we delegate to it rather than hand-rolling. This
adapter only adapts the wrapper's :class:`~zemtik_govern.protocols.AuditEntry` to
``AuditLog.log`` and re-exposes verification so callers can prove the trail
without reaching past the boundary.

One thing it MUST do: thaw the frozen ``GovernanceContext`` payload back to plain
``dict``/``list`` before handing it to agentmesh. agentmesh hashes each entry with
``json.dumps``, which rejects the ``MappingProxyType`` the context is deep-frozen
into — so an unthawed payload would crash the write (or, worse, silently degrade
to ``str``). The bytes policy saw stay the bytes audit records.

On a primary-sink failure the write is routed through the redacted emergency
fallback (:mod:`zemtik_govern.audit.fallback`) and then re-raised as a
:class:`~zemtik_govern.errors.GovernanceError`: the denial invariant holds
unconditionally — the guarded tool never runs even when audit cannot.
